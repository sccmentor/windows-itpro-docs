- **Option 3**: [Onboard through Microsoft Endpoint Manager version 2002 and later](#option-3-onboard-windows-servers-through-microsoft-endpoint-manager-version-2002-and-later)


After completing the onboarding steps using any of the provided options, you'll need to [Configure and update System Center Endpoint Protection clients](#configure-and-update-system-center-endpoint-protection-clients).


> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Endpoint standalone server license is required, per node, in order to onboard a Windows server through Microsoft Defender Security Center (Option 1), or an Azure Security Center Standard license is required, per node, in order to onboard a Windows server through Azure Security Center (Option 2), see [Supported features available in Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-services).


### Option 1: Onboard by installing and configuring Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA)
You'll need to install and configure MMA for Windows servers to report sensor data to Defender for Endpoint. For more information, see [Collect log data with Azure Log Analytics agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/log-analytics-agent).

If you're already leveraging System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or Azure Monitor (formerly known as Operations Management Suite (OMS)), attach the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) to report to your Defender for Endpoint workspace through Multihoming support.

In general, you'll need to take the following steps:
1. Fulfill the onboarding requirements outlined in **Before you begin** section.
2. Turn on server monitoring from Microsoft Defender Security center.
3. Install and configure MMA for the server to report sensor data to Defender for Endpoint.
4. Configure and update System Center Endpoint Protection clients.


> [!TIP]
> After onboarding the device, you can choose to run a detection test to verify that it is properly onboarded to the service. For more information, see [Run a detection test on a newly onboarded Defender for Endpoint endpoint](run-detection-test.md).


#### Before you begin 
Perform the following steps to fulfill the onboarding requirements:

 - For Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 or Windows Server 2012 R2, ensure that you install the following hotfix:
    - [Update for customer experience and diagnostic telemetry](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3080149/update-for-customer-experience-and-diagnostic-telemetry)

### Install and configure Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) to report sensor data to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

1. Download the agent setup file: [Windows 64-bit agent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=828603).

2. Using the Workspace ID and Workspace key obtained in the previous procedure, choose any of the following installation methods to install the agent on the Windows server:
    - [Manually install the agent using setup](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-windows-agents#install-the-agent-using-setup) <br>
    On the **Agent Setup Options** page, choose **Connect the agent to Azure Log Analytics (OMS)**.
    - [Install the agent using the command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-windows-agents#install-the-agent-using-the-command-line) and [configure the agent using a script](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-windows-agents#add-a-workspace-using-a-script).



<span id="server-proxy"/>

### Configure Windows server proxy and Internet connectivity settings if needed
If your servers need to use a proxy to communicate with Defender for Endpoint, use one of the following methods to configure the MMA to use the proxy server:


- [Configure the MMA to use a proxy server](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/agent-windows#install-agent-using-setup-wizard)

- [Configure Windows to use a proxy server for all connections](configure-proxy-internet.md)

If a proxy or firewall is in use, please ensure that servers can access all of the Microsoft Defender ATP service URLs directly and without SSL interception. For more information, see [enable access to Defender for Endpoint service URLs](configure-proxy-internet.md#enable-access-to-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-service-urls-in-the-proxy-server). Use of SSL interception will prevent the system from communicating with the Defender for Endpoint service. 

Once completed, you should see onboarded Windows servers in the portal within an hour.

### Option 2: Onboard Windows servers through Azure Security Center
1. In the Microsoft Defender Security Center navigation pane, select **Settings** > **Device management** > **Onboarding**.

2. Select **Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, 2012 R2 and 2016** as the operating system.

3. Click **Onboard Servers in Azure Security Center**.

4. Follow the onboarding instructions in [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-wdatp).

After completing the onboarding steps, you'll need to [Configure and update System Center Endpoint Protection clients](#configure-and-update-system-center-endpoint-protection-clients).

> [!NOTE]
> - For onboarding via Azure Defender for Servers (previously Azure Security Center Standard Edition) to work as expected, the server must have an appropriate workspace and key configured within the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) settings.
> - Once configured, the appropriate cloud management pack is deployed on the machine and the sensor process (MsSenseS.exe) will be deployed and started. 
> - This is also required if the server is configured to use an OMS Gateway server as proxy.

### Option 3: Onboard Windows servers through Microsoft Endpoint Manager version 2002 and later
You can onboard Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 by using Microsoft Endpoint Manager version 2002 and later. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
 in Microsoft Endpoint Manager current branch](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/configmgr/protect/deploy-use/defender-advanced-threat-protection).

After completing the onboarding steps, you'll need to [Configure and update System Center Endpoint Protection clients](#configure-and-update-system-center-endpoint-protection-clients).

## Windows Server (SAC) version 1803, Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2019 Core edition
You can onboard Windows Server (SAC) version 1803, Windows Server 2019, or Windows Server 2019 Core edition by using the following deployment methods:

- [Local script](configure-endpoints-script.md) 
- [Group Policy](configure-endpoints-gp.md)
- [Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager](configure-endpoints-sccm.md)
- [System Center Configuration Manager 2012 / 2012 R2  1511 / 1602](configure-endpoints-sccm.md#onboard-devices-using-system-center-configuration-manager)
- [VDI onboarding scripts for non-persistent devices](configure-endpoints-vdi.md)

> [!NOTE]
> - The Onboarding package for Windows Server 2019 through Microsoft Endpoint Manager currently ships a script. For more information on how to deploy scripts in Configuration Manager, see [Packages and programs in Configuration Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/configmgr/apps/deploy-use/packages-and-programs).
> - A local script is suitable for a proof of concept but should not be used for production deployment. For a production deployment, we recommend using Group Policy, Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, or Intune.

Support for Windows Server provides deeper insight into server activities, coverage for kernel and memory attack detection, and enables response actions.

1. Configure Defender for Endpoint onboarding settings on the Windows server. For more information, see [Onboard Windows 10 devices](configure-endpoints.md).

2. If you're running a third-party antimalware solution, you'll need to apply the following Microsoft Defender AV passive mode settings. Verify that it was configured correctly:

    1. Set the following registry entry:
       - Path: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection`
       - Name: ForceDefenderPassiveMode
       - Type: REG_DWORD
       - Value: 1

    1. Run the following PowerShell command to verify that the passive mode was configured:

       ```PowerShell
       Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{ProviderName="Microsoft-Windows-Sense" ;ID=84}
       ```

    1. Confirm  that a recent event containing the passive mode event is found:

       ![Image of passive mode verification result](images/atp-verify-passive-mode.png)

3. Run the following command to check if Microsoft Defender AV is installed:

   ```sc.exe query Windefend```

    If the result is 'The specified service does not exist as an installed service', then you'll need to install Microsoft Defender AV. For more information, see [Microsoft Defender Antivirus in Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/microsoft-defender-antivirus-in-windows-10).
    
    For information on how to use Group Policy to configure and manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus on your Windows servers, see [Use Group Policy settings to configure and manage Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/use-group-policy-microsoft-defender-antivirus).

## Integration with Azure Security Center
Defender for Endpoint can integrate with Azure Security Center to provide a comprehensive Windows server protection solution. With this integration, Azure Security Center can leverage the power of Defender for Endpoint to provide improved threat detection for Windows Servers.

The following capabilities are included in this integration:
- Automated onboarding - Defender for Endpoint sensor is automatically enabled on Windows Servers that are onboarded to Azure Security Center. For more information on Azure Security Center onboarding, see [Onboarding to Azure Security Center Standard for enhanced security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-onboarding).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Automated onboarding is only applicable for Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows Server 2016.

- Windows servers monitored by Azure Security Center will also be available in Defender for Endpoint - Azure Security Center seamlessly connects to the Defender for Endpoint tenant, providing a single view across clients and servers.  In addition, Defender for Endpoint alerts will be available in the Azure Security Center console.
- Server investigation -  Azure Security Center customers can access Microsoft Defender Security Center to perform detailed investigation to uncover the scope of a potential breach.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - When you use Azure Security Center to monitor servers, a Defender for Endpoint tenant is automatically created (in the US for US users, in the EU for European and UK users).<br>
Data collected by Defender for Endpoint is stored in the geo-location of the tenant as identified during provisioning.
> - If you use Defender for Endpoint before using Azure Security Center, your data will be stored in the location you specified when you created your tenant even if you integrate with Azure Security Center at a later time.
> - Once configured, you cannot change the location where your data is stored. If you need to move your data to another location, you need to contact Microsoft Support to reset the tenant. <br>
Server endpoint monitoring utilizing this integration has been disabled for Office 365 GCC customers.


## Configure and update System Center Endpoint Protection clients

Defender for Endpoint integrates with System Center Endpoint Protection. The integration provides visibility to malware detections and to stop propagation of an attack in your organization by banning potentially malicious files or suspected malware.

The following steps are required to enable this integration:
- Install the [January 2017 anti-malware platform update for Endpoint Protection clients](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3209361/january-2017-anti-malware-platform-update-for-endpoint-protection-clie).

- Configure the SCEP client Cloud Protection Service membership to the **Advanced** setting. This can be achieved by creating or editing an [Antimalware Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/protect/deploy-use/endpoint-antimalware-policies#cloud-protection-service).



## Offboard Windows servers
You can offboard Windows Server (SAC), Windows Server 2019, and Windows Server 2019 Core edition in the same method available for Windows 10 client devices.

For other Windows server versions, you have two options to offboard Windows servers from the service:
- Uninstall the MMA agent
- Remove the Defender for Endpoint workspace configuration

> [!NOTE]
> Offboarding causes the Windows server to stop sending sensor data to the portal but data from the Windows server, including reference to any alerts it has had will be retained for up to 6 months.

### Uninstall Windows servers by uninstalling the MMA agent
To offboard the Windows server, you can uninstall the MMA agent from the Windows server or detach it from reporting to your Defender for Endpoint workspace. After offboarding the agent, the Windows server will no longer send sensor data to Defender for Endpoint.
For more information, see [To disable an agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-windows-agents#to-disable-an-agent).

### Remove the Defender for Endpoint workspace configuration
To offboard the Windows server, you can use either of the following methods:

- Remove the Defender for Endpoint workspace configuration from the MMA agent
- Run a PowerShell command to remove the configuration

#### Remove the Defender for Endpoint workspace configuration from the MMA agent

1. In the **Microsoft Monitoring Agent Properties**, select the **Azure Log Analytics (OMS)** tab.

2. Select the Defender for Endpoint workspace, and click **Remove**.

#### Run a PowerShell command to remove the configuration

1. Get your Workspace ID:

   1. In the navigation pane, select **Settings** > **Onboarding**.

   1. Select **Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, 2012 R2 and 2016** as the operating system and get your Workspace ID:

      ![Image of Windows server onboarding](images/atp-server-offboarding-workspaceid.png)

2. Open an elevated PowerShell and run the following command. Use the Workspace ID you obtained and replacing `WorkspaceID`:

    ```powershell
    $ErrorActionPreference = "SilentlyContinue"
    # Load agent scripting object
    $AgentCfg = New-Object -ComObject AgentConfigManager.MgmtSvcCfg
    # Remove OMS Workspace
    $AgentCfg.RemoveCloudWorkspace("WorkspaceID")
    # Reload the configuration and apply changes
    $AgentCfg.ReloadConfiguration()

    ```
